_In this job I learned to rewrite my first scripts, full of failures and errors, I improved them, I learned to understand the complexity of a command and I am just beginning to understand the codes and the logic that is handled in programming._


_Teamwork is something that is essential in this environment, having the courage to face a challenge and knowing that you can ask for help, gives you more encouragement to continue, there are no excuses for failure. It is these things that put you to the test both as an individual and as a team, and more as a person, more than helping is worrying about the other regardless of the distance miles._
